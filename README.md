# Smart Temperature Detector for Electronic Devices
## Project Overview
The Electronic Device Temperature Detector is designed to measure the temperature change of all electronic devices - whether they are in proper operating condition or not. However, measuring temperature is not always convenient, for example in situations such as using a gaming laptop, where getting the temperature of the rear exhaust fan in real time and displaying it is challenging. This highlights the importance of modular sensor and display components. By separating the temperature sensing part from the display part and transmitting the data via Bluetooth signals, they are made into a set of connected devices. The sensor device can be conveniently placed near the device under test, while the display device is located within visual range, thus providing real-time temperature information. In addition, machine learning models can be utilized to predict temperature changes in electronic devices. This innovative solution improves the accessibility and usability of temperature measurements and ensures a seamless monitoring experience for electronic devices.
